# Progress

## Current Status
- Project implemented
- All requirements met
- Architecture implemented as designed
- Tests passing

## What Works
- Core data models (Show, ShowTitle, CSVRow)
- Producer parsing logic with multiple separator detection
- Matching algorithm with title containment and metadata matching
- Mock data generation for testing
- Unit tests covering all key scenarios
- Performance optimization (parallel streams, indexing)

## What's Left to Build
- Integration with actual CSV file parsing
- Integration with actual database
- Additional matching criteria if needed
- UI for displaying results

## Known Issues
- None identified in current implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial design focused on fuzzy matching
- Revised to strict matching with null-aware comparisons based on requirements
- Implemented title containment check rather than exact matching
- Added support for multiple producer separators
- Optimized performance with parallel streams and indexing
