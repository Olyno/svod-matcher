# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core matching algorithm
- Building producer parser
- Creating test data structure

## Recent Decisions
- Decided on 100% confidence threshold for matches
- Chosen partial matching for producers
- Implemented null-aware field comparisons

## Next Steps
1. Implement core data models
2. Build producer parsing logic
3. Develop matching algorithm
4. Create mock data for testing
5. Implement unit tests
6. Optimize for performance

## Active Considerations
- How to handle special characters in titles
- Best approach for normalizing producer names
- Efficient indexing strategy for large datasets
